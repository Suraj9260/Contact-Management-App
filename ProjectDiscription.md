Project Description: Contact Management Application


This project is a Contact Management Application that allows users to add, edit, view, and delete contact information. The application consists of a frontend built with React, a backend using Express and Node.js, and a database powered by MongoDB.



1. Frontend (React)
The frontend of the application is developed using React.js. It provides an interactive user interface that allows users to manage contacts efficiently.

Features:
Contact List View: Displays a table with contact details such as first name, last name, email, phone, company, and job title.
Pagination: Allows users to view contacts in pages, improving usability when there are many contacts.
Add/Edit Contacts: Users can add new contacts or edit existing ones using a form.
Delete Contacts: Users can delete contacts, which updates both the UI and the backend database.
Loading State: A loading spinner is shown when data is being fetched or sent to the server, improving user experience.
Key Components:
ContactsTable: Displays all contacts in a table with functionalities for editing, deleting, and pagination.
ContactForm: A form that handles adding new contacts and updating existing ones.
API Integration: Axios is used to make HTTP requests to the backend for operations like fetching, adding, updating, and deleting contacts.
Technologies Used:
React.js for building the UI.
Material-UI for designing responsive and modern components.
Axios for making API calls to the backend.



2. Backend (Express.js with Node.js)
The backend is built using Express.js and Node.js, which handles requests from the frontend and communicates with the database.

Features:
CRUD Operations:
Create: Allows adding new contacts to the database.
Read: Retrieves all contacts or a specific contact.
Update: Updates an existing contactâ€™s information in the database.
Delete: Deletes a contact from the database.
API Endpoints:
GET /contacts: Retrieves all contacts or a specific contact based on filters.
POST /contacts: Adds a new contact to the database.
PUT /contacts/
: Updates an existing contact by its ID.
DELETE /contacts/
: Deletes a contact by its ID.
GET /all: Retrieves all contacts in the database for listing in the frontend.
Key Features:
RESTful API: The backend exposes RESTful endpoints to manage contacts. These endpoints are used by the frontend to send requests for CRUD operations.
CORS: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is enabled to allow the frontend and backend to communicate without issues related to different origins (ports in this case).
Error Handling: Proper error handling ensures that users are notified if something goes wrong with the backend operations (e.g., failed contact deletion or creation).
Technologies Used:
Express.js for handling HTTP requests.
Node.js as the runtime for running the backend server.
Cors for enabling cross-origin requests.
Axios (on frontend) to make HTTP requests to these endpoints.


3. Database (MongoDB)
The MongoDB database is used to store and manage contacts. It is a NoSQL database that stores data in the form of documents, making it flexible and easy to scale.

Key Features:
MongoDB Schema:
Contact Schema: Defines the structure for a contact, including fields like firstName, lastName, email, phone, company, and jobTitle.
CRUD Operations:
Create: New contacts are saved into the MongoDB database.
Read: Retrieves contacts from the database based on the request (either all or specific ones).
Update: Existing contacts are updated with new information.
Delete: Contacts are removed from the database based on their unique identifier (_id).
Technologies Used:
MongoDB as the NoSQL database to store contacts.
Mongoose: A MongoDB object modeling tool used to interact with MongoDB easily and define schemas for documents.
Project Workflow:
Frontend (React):

The user interacts with the UI to add, edit, view, or delete contacts.
The frontend sends HTTP requests to the backend (Express API) for CRUD operations.
On successful operations (e.g., contact added/updated/deleted), the UI is updated accordingly.
The frontend listens to changes and refreshes the data (fetching the latest contact list from the backend).
Backend (Express):

The backend handles the API requests and communicates with the MongoDB database.
The backend performs CRUD operations on the contact data and sends the responses back to the frontend.
Error handling ensures smooth user experience by providing appropriate error messages.
Database (MongoDB):

MongoDB stores the contact data and ensures data persistence.
Mongoose is used to interact with MongoDB, making it easier to define and manipulate data.



Summary:
This application provides a full-stack contact management system where users can interact with a user-friendly interface (frontend in React), perform operations on contact data through RESTful APIs (backend in Express), and store/manage the contact information in MongoDB
